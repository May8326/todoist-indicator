# Todoist Indicator - GNOME Shell Extension

> [!NOTE]  
> This is a fork from [Tarelda's todoist-indicator extension](https://github.com/tarelda/todoist-indicator), which itself was forked from the original [todoist-gnome-shell-extension](https://github.com/ubuntudroid/todoist-gnome-shell-extension) project.

A simple, unofficial Todoist extension for GNOME Shell that displays the count of open tasks in the top panel and provides quick access to your past due and today's tasks through a convenient dropdown menu.
